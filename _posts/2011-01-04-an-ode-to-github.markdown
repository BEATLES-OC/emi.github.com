title: An Ode to Github

synopsis: Oh, Github, how we love thee, e'en through hail, sleet and other misfortune

We've been on the github bandwagon a long time now; the adoption was early enough that we show up in
the marquee of paying customer logos encouraging you that real companies pay for github -- maybe you
should too! And it's true. One of our group's founders has a favorite phrase: "There are two kinds of
technologies we use. The ones that have screwed us and had to be thrown away, and the ones that
haven't screwed us yet." There have certainly been some growing pains along the way, with
interruptions and slooooow pushes and pulls, but the reality is that github has been more reliable
than a server we would have hosted on our own.

And github is more of a service than we would have ever built on our own, with features like
github-pages. I've used them (a little) on my personal account, and its great to bring them on line now for
our github account in blog format (thanks to the [Envy Labs cheat
sheet](http://blog.envylabs.com/2009/08/publishing-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll/)).
